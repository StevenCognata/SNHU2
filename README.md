User stories help everyone involved. They are typically written by the development team. They are usually interpreted during scrum meetings and are used as guidlines
or blue prints so to speak. Agile approach is more flexible and that is usally good in a field like this because everything is constantly changing and us programmers
are always learning and adapting. A good programmer and team member is always trying your best and having no ego in order to learn.
